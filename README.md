# Binary Search Trees Implementation

This project implements three types of binary search trees:
- **Standard Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **AVL Tree** (Self-balancing BST)
- **Red-Black Tree (RBT)** (Self-balancing BST with color properties)

Each tree supports insertion, deletion, and search operations.
